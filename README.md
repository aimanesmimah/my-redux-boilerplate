This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

we used 3 main components as an exemple to populate our redux store :

* Classroom

* Students

* Student 

As well an 'actions' reducer that consists of properties of the UI state depending on user interaction
